# Bend-lang: Nearest Neighbors Descent (Approximates Nearest Neighbors)
Please see PyNNDescent for more on [the strategy that this implements](
https://pynndescent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_pynndescent_works.html). This
project is built in [Bend (language)](https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/bend),
and can be run using `make`, which outputs its usage as the default behavior.
The algorithm used is different from the original in an attempt to make it more
parallelizable.

## Project Status
